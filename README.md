# Face-Recognition-Glasses
Human Visual System plays an important role in
recognizing information regarding surroundings.
Smart eye which helps the blind and visually impaired
people to commute freely by experiencing their
surroundings.Distance is measured using ultrasonic sensor.
Surrounding is captured by camera and the data is
processed and compared with the array of known data.
Using text to speech synthesizer software the result from
the processed data is conveyed to user through
earphones.
